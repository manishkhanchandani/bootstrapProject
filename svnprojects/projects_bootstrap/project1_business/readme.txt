good morning Manish,   i was hoping i would not have to answer any questions and the website just appeared like magic. 


My Marking Lead generator is   Thumbtack.com.  i spend  200 a month on that site and stay plenty busy.    It would be very nice to start naturally populating the top page  and getting some other exposure to my company.  


Ok.     the Splash page is really going to be a modern design that you pick. a templete that loads real easy on a smart phone scrolls down but is not endless. 

Because i am into other things on the net i want to keep my  General Contracting separate from lets say a   domain i have call ed   Gliblip.com.  where i am hard on politicians.  in my GC business i must be nutrual or have some many customers that i can now choose to work for my political party only.  I do not see that happening   

The Page come up.    two pics should be on the header these pics are taken from  Treasure island so  we would see san Francisco on the right and Oakland Alamenda on the Left.     with my   Domain name accoss both pics  wide but not so tall. 

1.Ask the General.    SO i dont know if that needs to be clicked or will it just show up when people scoll down.
