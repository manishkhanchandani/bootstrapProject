5. Document Ready
Document ready is about web page loading and incorporate jQuery to web page.
Document ready is an Event Binding and it executes when DOM on web page is loaded.

In pure javascript, there is function called "window.onload" which is used to call when all the elements are loaded in the body.
Document Ready is faster & smarter than window.onload.

Its a good practice to put jQuery code inside Document Ready.


<script>
$( document ).ready(function() {
    console.log( "ready!" );
});
</script>
