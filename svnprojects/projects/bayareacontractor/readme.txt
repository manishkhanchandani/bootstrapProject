Domain Name
 
If you are using an existing domain with your new hosting account, you will need to update the nameservers to point to the nameservers listed below.
You have to go to your current domain registrar and change the domain name nameservers info to the nameservers below. After that your domain name will point to your new web hosting account with us. In order this to be completed, you have to wait about 24 hours for the nameservers records all around the world to be updated, from your registrar nameserver database.
If you have an existing site and you want to move it to the new hosting space with us, you have first to upload your pages using Temporary FTP that listed below and then to change the nameservers in order to minimize downtime to zero. This way your site will be visible on both servers the old and the new during the nameservers change and you will not have any downtime.
If you want help from us moving your site send an e-mail to support@giganetwebhosting.com or open a ticket at our support system, a dedicated support technician will help you during the process.
Nameserver 1: ns1.justnameserver.net
67.225.208.62
Nameserver 2: ns2.justnameserver.net
67.225.208.63
 
 
Uploading Your Website
Temporarily you may use one of the addresses given below to manage your web site:
Temporary FTP Hostname: 67.225.208.62
Temporary Webpage URL: http://67.225.208.62/~thebayar/
 
And once your domain has propagated you may use the details below:
FTP Hostname: thebayareacontractor.com
Webpage URL: http://www.thebayareacontractor.com
Also you may use the cpanel File Manager to upload your files without using any FTP application.
 
Email Settings
For email accounts that you setup, you should use the following connection details in your email program:
POP3 Host Address: mail.thebayareacontractor.com
SMTP Host Address: mail.thebayareacontractor.com
Username: The email address you are checking email for
Password: As specified in your control panel
For help about configuring e-mail clients go to our knowledgebase.
You have also WEB MAIL so you could manage and view e-mails directly from the server.
In order to be able to use webmail you have to enable it from the webmail ICON at your Cpanel.
When using web mail or e-mail clients please do not leave e-mails that you have read remaining at the server for long time but download them to your computer for security and server performance reasons.
 
General problems to avoid:
      - filenames are case sensitive so they must match or you will get a file not found error.
      - transfer perl scripts and text files as ASCII text
      - transfer gif and jpg images as image or binary file type
      - MAC users should transfer files as raw data
      - if your perl script doesn't work, the two most common reasons are permissions are not set right either on the scripts or files and directories they write to, or the paths are wrong.

good morning Manish,   i was hoping i would not have to answer any questions and the website just appeared like magic. 


My Marking Lead generator is   Thumbtack.com.  i spend  200 a month on that site and stay plenty busy.    It would be very nice to start naturally populating the top page  and getting some other exposure to my company.  


Ok.     the Splash page is really going to be a modern design that you pick. a templete that loads real easy on a smart phone scrolls down but is not endless. 

Because i am into other things on the net i want to keep my  General Contracting separate from lets say a   domain i have call ed   Gliblip.com.  where i am hard on politicians.  in my GC business i must be nutrual or have some many customers that i can now choose to work for my political party only.  I do not see that happening   

The Page come up.    two pics should be on the header these pics are taken from  Treasure island so  we would see san Francisco on the right and Oakland Alamenda on the Left.     with my   Domain name accoss both pics  wide but not so tall. 

1.Ask the General.    SO i dont know if that needs to be clicked or will it just show up when people scoll down.
