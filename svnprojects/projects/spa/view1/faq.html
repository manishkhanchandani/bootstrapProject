      </div>
      <h4>Why you serve at home specially.</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Actually, after the each of therapy, either it is any traditional or tantric, your body must have at least 1-2 hours full rest. But if you go at any spa, you do not have much time or comfort for that specific rest. which puts you again in same depression and tiredness within next 3-4 hours. That's why we do it at your door step... at your home or at your convenient place. so that after the therapy you have a good time to store the permanent relaxation in your body.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>How do the massage happens at home then?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>We carry our Spa kit with us which includes all the spa stuff like Oils, Gels, Lantern, Candles, Towels, Music etc. We do not carry Massage table. We prepare the environment there at your place before the therapy.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Does Tantra is done by women to women?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>No, Since it is a Tantric practice we need the exact stimulation to achieve the targeted relaxation, it is tantric rule that the therapy must be done my cross gender only. so it will be male to female</p>
      </div>
      <h4>But how to trust on a male Therapist?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>We are professional tantra expert. What we learnt is first control our mind, then make the client in control. We are not such a cheap spa therapist as there are in the city. We are well trained, and that's why we are little expensive. We say it proudly that we are the best ans most asked Tantra Specialist in India.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Is this a discreet service? I don't want my neighbours/hotel concierge to know.</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Absolutely. The key part of our service is our discreetness. Our masseuses will always dress appropriately, typically in a discreet civilian dress and a bag for their equipment(s). NO bright colours, NO leopard print stilettos. Most of our clients stay in world class 5 Star hotels, so our therapists are well versed in how to discreetly come straight to your room without being seen by concierge. If you are in a serviced apartment, then our masseuse will present themselves as your friend or work colleague to concierge.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>What is the time period i can book for. I am not comfortable in day hours.</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Yes, You can book anytime you prefer in 24 hours as we started our services 24x7 for our clients. Yet we have fixed the Night Hours (08 PM to 06AM) for which we charge a nominal fee of Rs. 1000 (for Delhi NCR) and 2000 (for rest of our service area) additional.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>I´m embarrassed about a certain part of my body what should I do?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Our therapists understand that some clients may have different bodily issues. Some of the most commonly re-occurring concerns are scars, being overweight, excess skin, lots of body hair, skin conditions such as eczema and so on. Your AAdi's Spa masseuse is a professional who has dealt with all types of people and will not be phased by things of this nature. However, if you are very concerned about something and are perhaps too embarrassed to speak directly with the masseuse, you should mention it in our real time chat box or in your booking form.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Is this service legal?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Yes. AAdi's Spa massage is a professional massage agency, we do NOT provide escort type services and neither do we accept clients soliciting sexual services from our masseuses.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Do I need to be completely naked?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>It is normal and recommended to be nude during a tantric massage. However, if you prefer to not be naked for any reason this can also be accommodated. Please make our dedicated therapist aware of any special requests at the time of your booking.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>The pressure is too strong / not strong enough for my liking, how do I raise it without insulting the masseuse?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>If any aspect of the massage is not to your liking than you must always tell your masseuse. Far from being offended, he will be more than happy to adapt her technique to make sure you get the full enjoyment of your massage.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Can someone else be in the room during the massage?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>if he is your partner then yes he can stay in room until he do not disturb and Under no circumstance is someone else allowed to be in the room. Your masseuse has the right to leave without completing the massage therapy if another person enters the room and does not leave or if there is someone hiding in the room in which the massage takes place. If you are looking to enjoy a massage as a couple then please mention it during filling your booking form.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Do I have to tip the masseuse?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>No. The price you pay covers the full cost of the massage and everything else such as travel. It is not necessary to tip your masseuse, but of course your are welcome to tip him if you feel inclined to do so.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Can I fall asleep? What happens if I fall asleep?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Firstly, yes you are absolutely allowed to fall asleep and your therapist will not mind because it is a sign that he has successfully made you feel totally relaxed. If you do fall asleep, your therapist will continue the massage as normal for the remainder of your massage time but perhaps modifying it slightly so as to not disturb your restful state.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Will the massage therapist watch me undress?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Not necessarily. When your masseuse arrives, he will be pre-occupied with setting up the room, preparing his equipment and getting him self freshened up before she commences the massage. It is very unlikely that he will have time to watch you undress.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Is the masseuse fully qualified?</h4>
      <div>
        <p>Our masseuses receive training provided by professional therapists with years of industry experience. However, if you are looking for an NTMI qualified therapist please let us know at the time of your booking and you will be assigned a therapist with relevant qualifications.</p>
